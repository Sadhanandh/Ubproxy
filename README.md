Tkinter bindings of Ubproxy 

ubproxy was originally commandline only .
But a lot of people requested a GUI version as the commandline parameters were confusing.

Requires - python-tk

in Ubuntu - "sudo apt-get install python-tk"



It changes the proxy environment variables in /etc so needs to be executed as root

Usage -
		sudo ./ubproxy
